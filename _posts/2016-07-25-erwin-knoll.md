"My own peculiar role at *The Progressive* is to provide regular instruction in the science of how to keep laughing, even though you've considered all the facts. And there was never such a magazine for making you consider all the facts as Erwin Knoll's *Progressive*. And there was never anyone easier to make laugh than Erwin Knoll."

Molly Ivins, "An Easy Laugh," *The Progressive* 59 (1995): 54.
