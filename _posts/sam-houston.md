"I think of Sam Houston as the first professional Texan, always prepared to gross out stuff Easterners obsessed with petty proprieties."

Molly Ivins, "NEED TITLE," *Fort Worth Star-Telegram*, March 4, 1993.

Molly Ivins, "Gather a Few Texans Together, and there His Great Spirit Will Be Also," in *Nothin' but Good Times Ahead* (New York: Vintage Books, 1994), Need page number.

Note: This is more of a tribute than an obituary. Ivins wrote it almost 130 years after Sam Houston died.
