"I don't know that Parten was ever liberal in his views, but he was an immensely civilized man, with a deep reverance for the Constitution. He read widely and had great faith in this country. Of course, he had himself gone from picking cotton in East Texas as a boy to the university and on to become one of the wealthiest men in the country. So he always worked to make sure others had the same kind of opportunities."
