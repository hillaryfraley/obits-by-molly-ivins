# obits-by-molly-ivins

This is a GitHub Pages-hosted Jekyll site that lists citations for obituaries written by the late Molly Ivins. I want to list a citation for every obituary that Molly Ivins wrote.

## How to contribute
Thank you for being interested! I'm grateful for your help.

If you know of an obituary that Molly Ivins wrote that I haven't included already, would you please consider adding an [issue](https://github.com/hillaryfraley/obits-by-molly-ivins/issues) or submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/hillaryfraley/obits-by-molly-ivins/pulls)?

If you want to submit a PR with a new post, please:
1. Follow the file naming and content format of [any post in the `posts` folder](https://github.com/hillaryfraley/obits-by-molly-ivins/tree/gh-pages/_posts).
2. Write it in GitHub-flavored Markdown.

Include a clear log message for your commit---one line is enough.
`$ git commit -m "Brief summary of your commit, starting with feat: or fix:"`

Thanks again!
