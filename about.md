### Thank you for visiting!

Many people enjoy Molly Ivins's political writing, but I *love* her obituaries. They have all the best qualities of her writing: generous, funny, touching, sharp...and in Richard Nixon's case, ferocious. I want more people to find and read them!

I want to list a citation for every obituary that Molly Ivins wrote. If I'm missing one, would you please let me know at hillary at setcorrect.com? Thank you in advance.
